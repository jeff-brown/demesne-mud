  long: You are now in a fairly large, but somewhat filthy cavern which smells of
    urine and excrement. Tattered rags, broken bones, as well as ruined weapons litter
    the floor. You get a great sense of foreboding as you realize the carnage that
    must have taken place here.

  long: The ceiling of this cavern is shrouded in darkness above your head. The whole
    room is roughly circular with the exit to the south. Though the walls and floor
    give away the fact that many battles have been fought here, and several of them
    recently, you see no sign of the slain or the equipment they may have carried.

  long: You gape in awe at the piles of skulls in the center of this huge stone room.
    The walls of this room are draped with the furs and skins of many different types
    of animals, among which you recognize the furs of several cave bears, formidable
    opponents themselves.

  long: You stand in a circular shaft with a stairwell that descends around the outer
    wall into the darkness below. The air in this chamber is somewhat cooler then
    the room you just left. From far below comes a faint shuffling sound that is barely
    audible and of which you can make nothing.
